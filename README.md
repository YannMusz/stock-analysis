# stock-analysis

## Overview and Purpose
Due to the diminishing returns of the use of fossil fuels and the movement towards alternative methods of producing energy such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, bioenergy and solar energy, we are asked to create a project using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to analyze hundreds of green stocks during the years 2017 and 2018.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to compare stock performance for 2017 and 2018 by using two scripting methods (Original and refractored) and determine which scripting method is the most efficient at providing us with the end result.

## Results

By running our macros, we were able to quickly and efficiently figure out what stocks provided a positive return and which stocks provided a negative one.
